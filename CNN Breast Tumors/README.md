# CNN Image Classification

This project will attempt to classify slides of breast tissue to assess malignancy. Convolutional Neural Network will be used to classify these images.


# Dataset
Kaggle Data Set Description from Kaggle:

"The BreaKHis database contains microscopic biopsy images benign and malignant breast tumors, wherein this dataset, I have done to separate training data and test data with different folders, each file has a different slide image. In this dataset I only took a partial sample of 400x optical zoom, if you are further interested in the dataset, please refer to this paper:

FA Spanhol, LS Oliveira, C. Petitjean and L. Heutte, "A Dataset for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification," in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, vol. 63, no. 7, pp. 1455-1462, July 2016, doi: 10.1109 / TBME.2015.2496264.

Given this, the dataset is not in my control. This dataset purpose is to deep learning learner."
